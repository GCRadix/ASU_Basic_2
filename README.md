# 🎧 Audio Scripting in Unity - Basic - Week 2

Welcome! This repo contains example scripts, a handout, and your first homework assignment.

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Open Unity and the project you created for Week 1, or create a new project from the Learning templates` FPS Microgame.
### 2. Drag the scripts from the `Scripts/` folder into your Unity project under `Assets/FPS/ASU_Basic_2/Scripts/`.
> ✅ Unity will auto-compile these as soon as they’re inside the `Assets/` directory. A nice way to check is to see if Unity has created `.meta` files for each of the imported scripts on disk.

### 3. Setting Up Rider with Unity

1. Open your Unity project.
2. Go to `Edit → Preferences → External Tools`.
3. Under **External Script Editor**, select **Rider**.
4. (optional) Check ✅ `Generate all .csproj files` (important for Rider's code understanding).
5. (optional) Unity will regenerate the project files automatically (you can also click **Regenerate project files** to refresh manually).
6. Open the project in Rider via `Asset > Open C# Project`.

> 💡 If Rider doesn't autocomplete Unity symbols, ensure the Unity plugin is enabled in Rider (`Settings → Plugins → Unity Support`). Though this should work automagically!
